# Summary:
A very simple Express Node React application which reads data from a file and displays it in the browser.

# Locations
The React application is built and served from ./client/build.
The express server is run with npm start and is served from ./bin/www
The file that is being read is located at ./resource/data.json (The format is a JSON array and printed with indent=4)

# Setup
1. run `npm install` from the top level
2. run `npm start` to start the server

The client build is included, so it should be immediately available. However, if needed the client can be rebuild as
follows:
1. `cd client`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build`

# Workflow
1. Upon opening the application relative route / (http://localhost:3000/), the application immediately requests the data from relative route /api/data (http://localhost:3000/api/data).
2. The response is displayed in a simple HTML table
3. This information is requested by the client at a set interval of 60 seconds.


# Python Updater

Even though the Python Updater is now included, running it will alter the data.json file whose current structure is being used by the client.

The client application would also need to be updated to accommodate new fields.
